# ZetaCarinaeModules

This project is for my VCV rack modules.  

The first module, the Brownian Bridge (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_bridge), interpolates between two given values over a given time with a stochastic process - a directed Brownian motion.

The second module implements an [Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornstein%E2%80%93Uhlenbeck_process) (also known as the Vasicek model in finance).  It is a Brownian motion that has an additional mean-reverting tendency, which can be useful compared to a Brownian motion that is reflected within a bounded interval.
